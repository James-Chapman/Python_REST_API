Design an API server with a REST interface that can run a series of long-term jobs in parallel.
A job is a shell operation that is called with the following executable: “/bin/longoperation”
The API must support the following use cases:
- user can start a new job
- user can request the list of currently running jobs
- user can request the list of stopped jobs
- user can request the list of completed jobs
- user can stop a job if this is currently running. An error will be returned if the job does not exist or is
already completed or stopped
If shut down, current running jobs will be tagged as stopped.
The server needs to be written in Python.
Please provides tests accordingly.
